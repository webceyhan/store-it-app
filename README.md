## üìÅ Project Structure

- `/app` - Next.js app directory (routes, pages, layouts)
- `/components` - Reusable UI and feature components
- `/lib` - Appwrite clients, utility functions, and server actions
- `/types` - TypeScript types and interfaces
- `/public` - Static assets

---

## üß© Key Concepts

- **Appwrite Integration**: All file and user actions are handled via Appwrite's SDK and REST APIs.
- **Server Actions**: Business logic and data fetching are implemented as server actions in `/lib/actions`.
- **Validation**: Forms use Zod schemas for robust validation.
- **Session Management**: Auth sessions are managed with secure cookies.
- **File Sharing**: Files can be shared with other users by adding their email to the file's access list.
